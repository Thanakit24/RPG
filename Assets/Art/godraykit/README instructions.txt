This is a series of images to use as overlays for your maps.  You will need to combine them with a lighting plugin.

We use Galv's Layer Graphics (MV).  If you don't know how to use it, we have a complete walkthrough here:  https://kokororeflections.com/free-lighting-rpg-maker-maps-guide/

The black ones should work with plugins like Yami's (VX Ace) although they may need to be darkened a little.

It's very likely that the lighting maps won't work too well right out of the box.  They're made extra-large so that you have plenty of room to trim and fit them properly to your map.  You can try them as they are, but they may bog down your game because they are very large.

We included several variations of each design so you can see what works best for you.

Because of the way RPG Maker's additive layering mode works, you may find that your lighting looks a little gray, too bright, too dim, just not right.  We included layered PSDs so you can alter them in any way you like, including adding colors.  

Try locking the layer pixels (it's different in every graphics app but there's usually a little icon on the layer palette) and using a gradient tool to color them with different colors like orange, yellow and red.  More saturation - more colorful effects.  It should look good with built-in tint functions in RPG Maker, but experiment and see what works best for you and your map's color and style.
